# OpenSSL patching

There are two patching methods available:
1. Using a patch generated by git diff.
2. Using a slightly smarter patch that doesn't depend on line numbers and can be 
applied to different versions of openssl.

## Option 1

Can only be used for **OpenSSL_1_1_1i** version .

## Option 2

| version | test results |
| :--- | :---: |
| OpenSSL_1_1_1i | :heavy_check_mark:      |
| OpenSSL_1_1_1j | :heavy_check_mark:      |
| OpenSSL_1_1_1k | :heavy_check_mark:      |
| OpenSSL_1_1_1l | :heavy_check_mark:      |
| OpenSSL_1_1_1m | :heavy_check_mark:      |
| OpenSSL_1_1_1n | :heavy_multiplication_x: (see [issue](https://github.com/bcrypto/bee2evp/issues/11#issue-1179528056))|

## Build script

Run script build.sh. Usage:
```text
"Script for patching OpenSSL."

"Syntax: build [-v|m]"
   "options:"
   "v     OpenSSL version"
   "m     Mode: 0 (simple patching) or 1 (smart patching)"
```
